- Full left/right is too quiet? when azimuth is +/-180. -180 should be the same as zero... when centre azimuth is 0. at 100% right azimuth is -3.14


- Crackles on playback of 'true' songs. Not on Sine wave...
- make the F-M coefs 1,0,0,0,etc and the crackles go away??
- crackles on 1st order still.
- 1st and 2nd bformat channels are fooooocked
- is the window functin tending to zero?
  -> thesis  = hanning with 75% overlap & 0.180ms stft
  -> current = hamming? with 50% overlap
   "The difference between them is that the Hanning window touches zero at both ends, removing any discontinuity. The Hamming window stops just shy of zero, meaning that the signal will still have a slight discontinuity"


far left?
Azimuth [0] : 171.354
Azimuth [1] : 179.637
Azimuth [2] : 180
Azimuth [3] : 0
Azimuth [4] : -21.0762
Azimuth [5] : -86.9282

far right and left are different? what?

add power function for debugging?

added a dezipper and it makes no f'in difference to the crackles?

crackles..
- dont happen in silence
- dont happen on W channel. Do happen on Y/X channel. Only difference is azimuth is moving on them?
- But dezipper did f'all?
- Different fft sizes has what effect? lower fft size = faster clicks. So related to fft, shockingly
- Apply a gain of 0.01 makes no difference to the cracks (not a clipping thing)
- still there with 1st order
- still there is azimuths remain constant
- doesnt happen if FM coefs are constant?
    furseMalhamCoefs[0] = 0.7071;
    furseMalhamCoefs[1] = 0.2;//cos(azimuth);
    furseMalhamCoefs[2] = -0.2;//sin(azimuth);
    furseMalhamCoefs[3] = 0; // elev only
extracted sources size and transfer buffer size not the same?

it must be in: addAudioOjectsAsBFormat ??

do this and clips are still there..
