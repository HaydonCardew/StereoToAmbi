I think I need to plot the histo at different points.. :(
Is not limiting the frequency the issue? Weighting too much to higher quiet freqs centred?

use weighted histogram
but how..

test 4 single non-moving sources. how close can they get?

cubed does worse than square? Do inverse? [NOTE: 1/2 & 1/3 don't have the same effect in the pow as 0.5?]

-- Width at 360 creates reasonable 0.5* expected answers.. Width at 180 fucks it totally?

Just playing one source does have glitching..
